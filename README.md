<h1>BoreDOM</h1>
<h3>Plan your night.</h3>

<p>Picture yourself getting home from work. You're tired of the same old routine. You want to do something new, but your busy schedule keeps you from exploring what's out there.</p>

<p>Introducing BoreDOM. This app will take your interests and turn them into options, by bringing an array of different activities and places to the table. Do you like reading? BoreDOM will give you a list of books from the Google Books API. Do you like to go out with your friends? BoreDOM will give you bars that match your price range and party style. Want to volunteer? BoreDOM can help.</p>

<li>Yelp</li>
<li>OMDB</li>
